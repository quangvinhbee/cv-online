          I am Lam Vinh, I am studying at the Post and Telecommunication
          Institute of Technology, HCMC. I'm a final-year student majoring in
          Information Security. I love web programming, I have been learning web
          programming since my freshman year. During my study, I learned some
          frameworks such as Wordpress, Bootstrap, ReactJS, NextJS,
          TailwindCSS... And I did some related work. I am looking for a job
          full time in Front end web programming (React JS). Thank you for
